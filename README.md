# The-Barber-Shop
Full Stack app for queuing a barber.

# Project Overview 
Have you ever been to a barbershop or to a hair salon and you didn't know how many people were waiting to get their hair done before you? This app offers a way of resolving that situation by creating a way for customers to sign up for a barber and track where they are on a list of customers from any device able to access this app. 

# Project Description 
This is a full stack app that is made with a React and Ruby on Rails framework. I created an API to apply CRUD to all custumer information as well as the barbers.
